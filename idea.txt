This is what I thought how to proceed.

1) Write the basic code for dijkstra's algorithm taking the required input and giving the correct output.
2) make sure the code is written in a modular form so that we can add/edit/omit the functions (parts of the code).
3) Dijkstra uses queue, so the queue should be implemented uses heaps.
4) find the code for binary heap (default), binomial heap and fibonacci heaps.
5) make a separate function for each of the queue and then plug it in the code.
6) before starting Dijkstra's main function ask the user which queue/heap he wishes to use.
7) calculate the time at the end of the code.
